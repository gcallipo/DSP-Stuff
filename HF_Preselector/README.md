 #### HF PRE Selector schematic:	
		
	This is a schematic written on Kicad free software
	to build a good HF filter reception frontend for 
	any Short Wave Radio Receiver. Inside the project
	you can find also a PDF version of schematic.
	I use two cheap multiplexer modules and some passive
	components to define each filter band. 
	It was successfully tested with the Radio DSP SDR Receiver.
